## Complexity Analysis

### Store
the whole dictionary is iterated exactly once and since accessing dictionary item is constant time then the complexity for store function is O(n) where n is the number of item in the dictionary. The same goes for memory complexity, since the stored data during processing grow linearly with the amount of input data, the memory complexity is O(n). 

### Load
the loading process iterate the entire string exactly once without any repetition hence it has O(n) complexity. the memory complexity is also O(n) since the program allocate memory as big as the input itself.
